Version: 2.0

Author: H. Mei, L. Li
Maintainer: H. Mei <hmei@umc.edu>
Description: The package integrates local genomic annotation databases based on NCBI dbSNP 
			 138 and 142, Entrez Gene 105 and 106 and MSigDB V4.0, and provides genome-wide annotation
			 for SNP, Gene and gene sets. It aims to support interpretation of genome-wide 
			 study (GWS) results and performing post-analysis. The package implements three categories
			 of functions: 1) genomic mapping annotation for SNPs and genes, and function annotation for
			 gene sets; 2) bidirectional mapping relationship between SNPs and genes, and between genes
			 and gene sets; and 3) flexible gene effect measure by SNP association and function-related
			 gene set/pathway identification by enrichment analysis. The auxiliary functions are also provided
			 to facilitate annotation and analysis.
